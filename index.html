	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p>
		The board is a grid of squares with the dimensions 25 x 25.  The arrow keys will control your character, the dog (the black square).  It is your goal to herd as many sheep (white squares) as possible into the pen (the brown square) as possible before they die.  Each turn will age the sheep.  As they grow older their color will be more faint.  Each turn the sheep will also breed and produce new sheep.
